# csc481-fa22
   This repository contains 5 directories each with one version of a game engine developed
   over the course of a semester of CSC 481.
   Each directory represents the deliverable for one of the five homework assignments,
   with the following functionality respectively.
    
    1. Using SFML to open window and facilitate basic character movement
    2. Client/server networked multiplayer using ZMQ sockets
    3. Component based game object model.
    4. Custom event management system.
    5. Scripting system using node js. HW 5 also includes an implementation of a flappy bird like game made with minimal changes to the engine to demonstrate the versatility and extensibility.

    Each homework directory contains a readme file with compilation and execution instructions.
